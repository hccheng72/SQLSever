--- An object is any SQL Server resource. SQL objects are schemas, journals, catalogs, tables, aliases, views, indexes, constraints, 
--- triggers, sequences, stored procedures, user-defined functions, user-defined types, global variables, and SQL packages. SQL creates 
--- and maintains these objects as system objects.
-- 2
--- An index is an on-disk structure associated with a table or view that speeds retrieval of rows from the table or view.
--- Index enables SQL Server to find the row or rows associated with the key values quickly and efficiently. On the contrary, 
--- it decreases performance when finding data with non-index columns and occupies more memory space.
-- 3
--- Clustered index: data in a table are sorted by it. There can ba only one clustered index per table.
--- Nonclustered index: there can be more than one per table. Data rows are not sorted.
--- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/clustered-and-nonclustered-indexes-described?view=sql-server-ver15
-- 4
--- No, but the clustered and nonclustered index will be created automatically with primary key and foreign key respectively.
-- 5
--- No, There can ba only one clustered index per table. Data only can be sorted based on a single index.
-- 6
--- Index can be created on multiple columns and the order of columns matters. The most likely column that would be used as specified 
--- column when finding data should be put as leftmost as possible.
-- 7
--- Yes, the first index created on a view must be a unique clustered index. After the unique clustered index has been created, 
--- you can create more nonclustered indexes. 
--- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/create-indexed-views?view=sql-server-ver15
-- 8
--- Normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
--- First Normal Form: There are no repeating groups of columns.
--- Second Normal Form: Above form is applied and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.
--- Third Normal Form: Above form is applied and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

-- 9
--- Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables to avoid costly joins.
--- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/denormalization-in-databases/
-- 10
--- Using foreign key that references to a primary key in another table, or CHECK constraint on a column to make sure the data in a row
--- satisfying some business rules.
-- 11
--- primary key, foreign key, null, not null, unique, check, default
-- 12
--- A table only has one primary key, but can have multiple columns with unique constraint. Primary key doesn't accept null value while 
--- unique key does. By default, primary key will create clustered index while unique key will create nonclustered index.
-- 13
--- Foreign Key is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables. 
--- It has to connect with a column of unique constraint in another table.
-- 14
--- Yes, a table can have multiple foreign keys.
-- 15
--- Foreign Key has to be unique and accepts null value since it refers to a column of unique constraint.
-- 16
--- SQL temp tables support adding clustered and non-clustered indexes after the SQL Server temp table creation and implicitly by 
--- defining Primary key constraint or Unique Key constraint during the tables creation, but table variables support only adding such 
--- indexes implicitly by defining Primary key constraint or Unique key constraint during tables creation.

-- 17
--- Transaction is a single recoverable unit of SQL statements. 
--- Types of transaction level include read uncommitted, read committed, repeated read, serializable, and snapshot.
